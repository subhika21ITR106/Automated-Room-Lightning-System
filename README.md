The Automatic Room Lighting System (ARLS) presented in this project leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technology to optimize energy consumption and enhance user convenience in indoor environments. Traditional lighting systems often lack adaptability to changing environmental conditions, leading to inefficiencies and unnecessary energy usage. In response, this project proposes a smart lighting solution that dynamically adjusts illumination levels based on factors such as occupancy, ambient light levels, and user preferences.The ARLS consists of interconnected IoT devices strategically placed throughout the room, including occupancy sensors, light sensors, and smart light bulbs. These devices communicate wirelessly through a local network, enabling real-time data exchange and decision-making. Machine learning algorithms embedded within the system analyze sensor data to predict lighting requirements and automate adjustments accordingly. The Key features of the ARLS include automatic dimming or brightening of lights based on occupancy status, time of day, and natural light levels. Users have the flexibility to customize lighting presets through a mobile application or web interface, allowing for personalized control and energy savings. Additionally, the system prioritizes safety by ensuring adequate illumination in areas with movement detected, enhancing security and comfort for occupants.Through simulations and real-world experiments, the effectiveness of the ARLS in optimizing energy usage while maintaining optimal lighting conditions is demonstrated. Results indicate significant reductions in electricity consumption compared to static lighting systems, with minimal impact on user comfort and productivity. The scalability and adaptability of the proposed solution make it suitable for various indoor environments, including residential, commercial, and industrial settings.
